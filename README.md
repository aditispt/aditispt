Director, Bioinformatics Core (OmicsInsight) â€” Wayne State University

**Computational immunology â€¢ scRNA-seq â€¢ multi-omics pipelines**
I build reproducible R/Python workflows that turn messy single-cell data into publishable biology.

### Featured work
- **Dendritic-Cells** â€” uDC scRNA-seq pipeline (QCâ†’UMAPâ†’CellChatâ†’GO) with GEO-linked data and reproducible `renv`.  
- **macromarker (dev)** â€” Seurat add-on to score macrophage subtypes (M1, M2aâ€“d, TAM flavors) with rank-based likelihood (in progress).

### ðŸ§ª Ongoing Projects
- **Placental Sexual Dimorphism (scRNA-seq)** â€” analysis of male vs. female fetal immune programming at the maternalâ€“fetal interface. *Manuscript in preparation; repository private until publication.*  
- **SNAhigh vs. SNAlow Tumor Microenvironment** â€” single-cell profiling of immune infiltration and macrophage diversity in ovarian cancer models. *In progress.*
